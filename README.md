Guidelines for a good, transparent open source "app market" - allowing marketing of proprietary apps, but fully embracing and preferring open source applications

## Basic principals
We at OSP focus on app market freedom. (yet: Limitations still apply.)
<ul>
<li>(Almost) every app is permitted in the app store.</li>

<li>Apps that promote, advertise, contain, redistribute or link to content related to violence, sex trafficking, child abuse/teen pornography or other content you are not allowed to share from your location are strictly prohibited.</li>
</ul>

## Specific guideline examples
<ul>
  <li>Virus-flagged apps are permitted to be hosted and will be offered for installations in developer mode. But every installation containing a virus requires a 5-10 day wait period, depending on how much the phone is used.</li>
  <li>If you make server-side changes because your app relies on your servers to an old version of the app you are required to be open about it and release a detailed public explanation about this.</li>
  <li>You can choose to update your app however: Through the app store, or by downloading the new assets from within your app.</li>
</ul>


# Financial dealings
<ul>
   <li>If you're only offering open source apps, your developer account is free.</li>
  <li>If you're an individual who doesn't want to reveal the code, we ask for at least 1$/month, you're welcome to give more.</li>
  <li>If you're a company, we may ask for a regstration or monthly hosting fee from you, based on the profits your company has made.
    We consider it "okay" for everybody if you provide us 0.25% of your yearly profits (profits: everything you earned via the service you're offering via the app) as a fee every 6 months + 0.01% per 10 GB that's downloaded. - This also encourages you to work on the size of your app. Apps shouldn't take up more space than needed on our servers, it saves our costs, yours, and the time of the user needed for downloading.</li>
 <li>If you're a company with 5 million USD net worth or more, we ask that you give us 0.5% of your yearly profits and 0.05% per 10 GB of downloads.</li>
  </ul>
